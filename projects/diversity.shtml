                                We both are women in tech with several years of experience. For this talk we want to look back to our last years in IT. Not everything has been as easy as you may think but it wasn't that difficult either.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having been part of the gender minority for years now the question still remains «Does diversity really matter? Or shall we just forget about this topic and accept it the way it has been?».
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway, we'd like to share with you some of our favorite stories we came along. All names and characters are fictious - all similarities with reality are completely intentional though ;-).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Imagine you know a woman who has been working in IT for 15 years. Just imagine. Let's call her Sarah. Completely fictional name. Let's go back to the beginning of her career when she considered working in IT.

                            <p>
                                Once upon a time Sarah came across her first tough business decision: she had to choose a career path. She remebers her thoughts back in the days:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>«I love Maths an Figures»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«But I am not a gamer or a nerd»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«I'm not a guy!»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«I don't want my girlfriends to think that I am weird.»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«Isn't it a dead-end job anyway?»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«I heard that the work-life-balance in that field is practically inexistent»</i></li>
                                </ul>

                            <h3>Some Facts</h3>
                            <p>
                                According to the <a href="https://www.ncwit.org" target="_blank">National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)</a>, 57 percent of professional occupations in 2015 in the U.S. workforce was held by women but only 25% of the computing workforce was female and even worse, only 17 percent of the Fortune 500 CIO positions were held by women in 2015.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The data in Switzerland is even worse. Only 13% of positions in the tech industry are held by women.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                According to <a href="https://www.girlswhocode.com/about-us" target="_blank">Girls who Code</a> the situation was better in 1995. The number of women computer scientists decreased in the last 20 years by 11 percent and their prediction says that it will get even worse in the future if we don't do anything about it. By the year 2027 the number will be down to 22 percent.

                            <p>
                                But let's go back to Sarah. How would it be in a galaxy far far away, where diversity isn't an issue anymore, where everything is possible, unicorns exist and agility actually works... ;-) How would her career choice look like there? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Questions about «Boys»- and «Girls»-Jobs aren't known. Getting a robot for Christmas is cool for girls, being a «Techie» as a woman isn't weird and a career choice is only a matter of passion. No stereotypes have to be considered.
                            </p>

                                How far away are we from that place and time? Is is really so unimaginable to get there some day?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No! According to <a href="https://www.girlswhocode.com/about-us" target="_blank">Girls who Code</a> a majority (66%) of girls in the age of 6 to 12 years show an interest in computer science. So that would be a good starting point!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunatly, almost have of them lose the interest when they get older and by the time they get to collage, only 4 percent say they are still interested in tech.

                                Back in MORDOR, Sarah decided to give her career in IT a shot - contrary to all external advisors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On her first day at university she started hearing voices. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>«Look, there's a girl!»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«what is SHE doing here?!»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«She must be in the wrong room...»</i></li>
                                    <li><i>«I bet she won't make it for more than two weeks.»</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do you think that was just her imagination? Or is there some truth to such stories?

                                Dice’s 2012-2013 annual salary survey found that the top five tech occupations for women and men differed significantly, with «Project Manager» as the top position for women and «Software Engineer» as the top position for men (Kawamoto, 2013).

                                In the perfect unicorn world, Sarah goes to university. There are almost the same number of girls and boys in the class. Even the professors are equally devided between men and women.

After finding the desired position, getting the job was not that hard. After all, what company nowadays can afford not having a woman on the team... sigh... quotas... sigh...

                                After enjoying a few highly interesting and rewarding years at university Sarah starts her job hunt. There are so many appealing opportunities that she has a hard time choosing. And after (womenlead) interviews (not just HR women, but tech women) it is even harder.

                                Once she starts her new job, finding her place in the team is not even considered a challenge. She is there because of her skills and she is measured by equal standards to her male peers. Isn't that amazing?

                               When asked whether being successful in a high-paying career or profession is one of the most important things or very interesting in their lives, 66 percent of young women answered YES, whereas only 59 percent of young men said yes.

                            <h3>Where are we now?</h3>
                            <p>
                               Back to reality... where do you think we are now? More in the MORDOR world or more in the Unicorn world?
                            </p>                            
                            <p>
                                When preparing this talk we realised that it is a lot easier to remember the MORDOR moments in our lives than the UNICORN moments. But they are there as well. We think it really depends on the topic you are talking about - sometimes we are a bit more in the Unicorn world and sometimes a bit more in the MORDOR world. But we think there is still a long way to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For us it is important to say, that we don't feel like victims in this world. We managed, and we still do it. We like being part of our teams and we like our peers. But what we are saying is, that it might be <i>even better</i> on a personal AND a professional basis if we had more diverse teams. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore it is important to notice that it is not just the gender minority we have to talk about. The same counts for ethnicity, color, religion, ... and so on.

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                               We often hear «Diversity is not a men's problem, women are just not interested enough in tech». We disagree to a certain point - after all, we chose to be a part of the tech world ourselves and we strongly believe that it is absolutely important to include all kind of people in the development of our future, independent of gender, age, color, culture, religion, ...
                            </p>                            
                            <p>
                                Altough the diversity issue has been worked on for several decades now, it is still among us. But we are all part of the problem - and the solution.
                            </p>
                            <p> But how can we foster diversity?</p>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> As an individual: Be aware of the unconsious biases we all grew up with and avoid to perpetuate them.</li>
<li>As a women in IT: Make your own work and your passion visible. Share role models and participate in initiatives about this topic.</li>
<li>As a company: Do not only think about quotas and positive discrimination. Create a safe and suitable work environment for all your employees, giving equal opportunities. You can also support organisations and projects that foster diversity, like <a href="https://www.weshape.tech" target="_blank">We Shape Tech</a>, <a href="https://www.girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>, <a href="https://www.djangogirls.com" target="_blank">Django Girls</a>,... </li>
<li>As a government: Support education initiatives to avoid biases. Develop specific programs to foster the interest of both girls and boys in technology and sciences.
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As we both said, not everything has been so bad. Actually we haven't been in Mordor in our lives. But our unicorn moments have been scarce. Let's imagine a - hopefully not so far in the future - world where everything is possible, unicorns exists and agility actually works....
