                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    We both are women in tech with several years of experience. For this talk we try to make a retrospective our our last years in IT. Not everything has been as easy as you may think, but it is not that difficult either. Having been part of the gender minority for years now, the question still is «Does Diversity really matter? Or shall we just forget about this topic and accept the way it has been?»
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, we like to share with you guys some our our favorite stories and anecdotes we came along. But remember, all names and characters are ficitious. All similarities with reality are completely intentional :-).
                </p>

                <h2>Mordor</h2>
                <p>
                    For example, imagine you know a woman who has been working in IT for 15 years. Just imagine. Let's call her Sarah. Completely fictional name. Let's go back to the beginning of her career, when she considered working in IT.
                </p>

                <h3>Career Choice</h3>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time Sarah came across her first tough business decision: she had to choose a carrer path. «I love Maths and figures... but I am not a nerd or a gamer, and I am not as good as a guy... Additionally, all my girlfriends think I'm weird. And... isn't it a dead end job anyway?»
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to all external advisors, she decided to give it a try anyway.
                </p>

                <h3>University</h3>
                <p>
                    On the very first day of university Sarah started hearing voices: «Look, there's a girl!», «She must be in the wrong room», «I bet she won't last more than 2 weeks» and «What is <i>SHE</i> doing here?»
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again: contrary to all expectations Sarah got through university <i>and</i> she even made some friends! :-D

                <h3>1st Job</h3>
                <p>
                    What do you do after university? - Let's find a job! (or a non-payed scholarship, or a non-payed apprenticeship or something else non-payed...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not that there are not plenty of open positions out there, but finding one not searching for «ninjas» or «geeks» has taken a while. After finding the desired position, getting the job was not that hard. After all, what company nowadays can afford not having a woman on a team... seufz - quotas - seufz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sarah was aware of that fact, so she was prepared to work 150% to prove herself - and guess what? - she actually did it!

                    After a few years being ignored in all promotion rounds, she saw herself good enough for the next level in her career. So she asked for a promotion. Be aware that - opposite to her male colleagues - she has to ASK for a promotion in order to be considered.

                <p>
                    Changing jobs every once in a while is considered a good thing if you’re pursuing your dreams. But changing job as a 32-years old woman is close to suicide. Despite the fact that companies are not supposed to ask the «Pregnancy» question, it is usually still the elephant in the room, whereas a military career for men is still considered normal.

                <p>
                    After working several years in cool projects and with big clients, Sarah did get pregnant, she did start a family, she did enjoy a maternity leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And after that, guess what, she did come back after only four months, and the company was soooo considered with her situation at home that she only got easy projects without responsibility because everybody knew, she would leave again anyway. An even if not, she is a mother and has other things to do.

                    Some years later Sarah came to another crossroads in her career. She got her first executive opportunity. She took the opportunity but she knew it would - again - be hard to be taking seriously. Actually, the easiest way would be to become a man... Afterall there must be something wrong with her. She looks more like an assistant, doesn’t she? (hear the irony in that?)

                    Let’s go back to those days when Sarah thought about the possibility of a technical career. Questions about «boys» and «girls»-jobs didn’t even came to her mind. It’s only a matter of passion without any stereotype.

                    Let’s go on. Imagine we’re back to university days. There are almost the same number of girls and boys on the class (just like in a party where everybody wants to stay). Even professors are equally divided between men and women. And the best: your absence is not immediately detected just because of your gender. You’re not longer <i>the girl of the class</i>.

                    After enjoying a few highly interesting and rewarding years at university Sarah started her job search. There are so many appealing opportunities that she has a hard time choosing. And after womenlead interviews (not HR women but technical women) it was even harder.

                    Once she started in her new position finding her place in a team was not even considered a challenge, she was there because of her skill. Is that not amazing?.

                    As in Mordor, changing jobs every once in a while is still considered a good thing. But opposite to Mordor, there are only unicorns in the room - no elephants. No questions about family planning, no awkward pregnancy questions, no forecast for your next 10 years are required. Only your skills and your experiences are considered - just as for men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the maternity/paternity leave is equal for men and women… that means extended leaves (indifferent for the reason) are not considered a disadvantage.

                    After her time-out she managed to work part time sharing job with somebody else. A different personal situation but same responsibilities. Nobody ask her if she would like to work less. Because flexibility is over presenteeism.

                    We often hear «Diversity is not a men's problem, women are just not interested enough in tech». We disagree to a certain point, after all, we chose the tech world ourselves and we strongly believe that it is absolutely important to include all kind of people in the development of our future - independent of gender, age, colour, culture, religion, ...

                    Although the diversity issue has been worked on for several decades now, it is still among us. But we are all part of the problem - and the solutions. But, how can we foster diversity?
